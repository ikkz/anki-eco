# Extensions

Extensions here are built on Anki card templates (not desktop addons), so they can run across platforms: Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile, AnkiDroid, and even AnkiWeb when applicable. By relying on HTML/CSS/JS inside templates, we aim for maximum portability with minimal setup.

## Available Extensions

- [CardMotion](/extension/card-motion) — Realistic flip and next‑card animations for your reviews. Highly customizable.
- [Tldraw](/extension/tldraw) — Integrate the powerful Tldraw whiteboard; draw and annotate directly on cards during review.
