# Input

Input template. Similar to anki's type field, but support any number of input boxes.

To use, wrap the text you want to cloze with double curly braces, for example, `{{text}}`. Multiple clozes and image/formula clozes are also supported.

AnkiDroid users should enable the "Type answer into the card" in Advanced Settings.
